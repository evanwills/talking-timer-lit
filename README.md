# `<talking-timer>` & `<speed-throwing>`


## `<talking-timer>`
`<talking-timer>` is a web component that counts down a specific time and announces intervals at user defined times.

It is useful for a number of things. Initially, I created it as to help me while teaching pottery. I also use it on a regular basis when poaching eggs. It also useful if you have a child that needs priming before they transition between tasks/activities.

## `<speed-throwing>`

`<speed-throwing>` is a web component that utilises the features of [`<talking-timer>`](#talking-timer) to create a structured/guided speed throwing session.
