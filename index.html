			<h2 id="what-is-speed-throwing">What is speed throwing?</h2>

			<p>Speed throwing is the practice of throwing a pot (often a cylinder) within a limited period of time (usually 3 minutes). The time limit pushes you to throw at the limit of your skill. Also by placing a limitation on the time, it forces you to focus on the act of throwing rather than being distracted by life. It is also a useful warm up exercise if you're going to throw a large batch of pots.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<strong>NOTE:</strong>
				<span>Even after 40 years of throwing, sometimes my mind is too busy to be able to throw effectively. Half an hour of speed throwing usually clears my mind enough that I can engage with my throwing and have a productive session.</span>

			<h2 id="aims-and-objectives">Aims and objectives</h2>

			<p>The aim of this exercise is to throw a pot in a limited period of time, using all the time available. But not more and not less.</p>

			<p>This is an exercise to extend your skills, or to help you focus, or both.</p>

			<p>The pots you make are just for exercise, not to keep. However, within the time limit, you should strive for personal excellence (which is not the same as perfection).</p>

			<p>To get the most out of the exercise, you should be pushing yourself to the limit of your skills. Whether it be striving to fully centre your clay within the first minute or make your cylinder as tall and thin as you can, pushing yourself without the requirement of keeping what you make, will improve your skills faster than anything else.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="about-failure">About failure</h2>

			<p>This is an exercise where the expectation is that you'll cut everything you make in half, so there's no need to be precious. If you're doing it right you'll also be pushing yourself to the limit of your skill. The important (but often disappointing) part of pushing yourself in this way, is that you'll often have failures. Don't squish or recycle the failures immediately. Instead, add them to the ware-board along with your successes. When it's time to review & critique your pots, think about what was going on when the pot failed. Also think about what went right with the pot, even though the final result was a failure.</p>
			<p>For most beginners (and many experienced potters) the first three or four speed thrown pots will get better with each pot. After that it is very common to see a decline in the quality. This is because your brain is getting tired.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="about-timing">About timing</h2>

			<p>If you make your pot in less than three minutes, you are probably missing things or not aiming for high enough quality.</p>

			<p>If you are not stopping when you run out of time, think about why. This is a three minute exercise. It's only an exercise. Stop at three minutes regardless of where you've got to and think about which steps you can save a bit of time on, next time.</p>

			<section>
				<h3 id="for-this-exercise">For the purposes of this exercise:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>The first third of your time (1 minute in a 3 minute run) should be devoted to centering as perfectly as you can.</li>
					<li>The next sixth of your time should be (30 seconds in a 3 minute run) should be for opening up.</li>
					<li>Most of the remaining time should be taken up by pulling up as high or as thin (or both) as you can.</li>
					<li>The final 10 to 15 seconds should be used for cleaning up the rim and the base and removing excess water.</li>
					<li>After the timer ends, cut your pot off the wheel and place it gently on your ware-board</li>
				</ul>

			<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

			<p>At the end of the three minutes carefully and gently place each pot on a ware-board for later review and critique.</p>

			<p>I recommend only making five to eight pots per session as the exercise can be very mentally exhausting, particularly for beginners.</p>

			<p>At the end of the session you should cut each pot in half (from top to bottom) and analyse what is going well and what could be improved on.</p>

			<p>At the end of the throwing part of the session (before you cut and critique) have a short break (no more than 10 minutes). This will give your brain a chance to recover from the exertion of the exercise.</p>

			<p>For the three minute exercise, I recommend only using 300 to 400 grams of clay. (10 to 15 ounces).</p>

			<p>I also recommend that you weigh each piece of clay and ensure that the weight of each piece doesn't vary by more than one or two percent (5 grams or â…™ of an ounce). This is just to help with predictability.</p>
			<p>For review and critique purposes, it's very helpful if you place your pots in order so when you come to cut them up, you can cut them up in order of creation.</p>

			<p>If, part way through your speed throwing session, you find the quality of your throwing has gotten worse than when you started the session, push on until you've done five repetitions then take a break. Have a cup of tea, a glass of water or do something to distract yourself. Come back after five or ten minutes and review and critique your efforts.</p>

			<section>
				<h3 id="speed-throwing-on-your-own">Speed throwing on your own</h3>

				<p>If you're speed throwing on your own, it's probably very helpful to video yourself doing the actual throwing. When you critique each pot, you can also review the video for that pot. This will help you see things you're doing while throwing that you may not be conscious of.</p>

			</section>

			<section>
				<h3 id="cutting-in-half">Cutting in half</h3>

				<p>This gets its own section because if you don't do it right you might not see the true shape of your work.</p>

				<p>To cut your pot in half, cut from the top down and stop at the bottom.</p>

				<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> drag the cutting wire out from under the pot as this will cut away some of the foot and misrepresent the actual thickness of the base of your pot.</p>

				<p>Instead, when you've dragged the wire as far down as you can, tear one half away from the other, so you don't leave any clay behind.</p>

			<h2 id="critiquing-your-pots">Critiquing your speed thrown pots</h2>

			<p>The greatest value of the speed throwing exercise is critiquing the pots you've made after the throwing part of the session.</p>

			<p>A critique is useless if you only look at the good or only look at the bad.</p>

			<p>Be kind and fair to yourself. The mistakes you make will have been made by every other potter in the world at one time or another.</p>

			<section>
				<h3 id="things-to-look-out-for">Things to look out for</h3>

				<p>By the end of the three minutes,</p>

				<ul>
					<li>There should be no water pooled in the bottom of your pot</li>
					<li>The walls of your pot should be an even thickness</li>
					<li>The rim should be even and parallel with the wheel head </li>
					<li>The walls should be the same thickness on opposite sides</li>
					<li>For cylinders:
						<ul>
							<li>The base inside your pot should be flat.</li>
							<li>The walls should be straight and vertical</li>
							<li>The base should be one and a half to two times the thickness of the walls</li>
							<li>The walls should be the same thickness all the way up</li>
						</ul>
					<li>For bowls
						<ul>
							<li>The steepest outside angle should be no less than 45 degrees</li>
							<li>From about a third of the way up, the walls should be the same thickness</li>
							<li>For this exercise, the curve of your bowl should not change direction</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

		<section>
			<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>A ware-board big enough to hold all the pots you're going to make in the speed throwing exercise</li>
				<li>Wooden knife to clean the base</li>
				<li>Needle tool to clean up the rim.</li>
				<li>Cutting wire to cut the pot off the wheel</li>
				<li>Sponge to apply and remove water.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="too-easy">Too easy?</h2>

			<p>If you're a beginner and you're not seeing a decline in the quality towards the end of your speed throwing session, it could be that you're playing it too safe and not pushing yourself hard enough. It could also be that you have gotten as good as you're going to get within the parameters you've set.</p>

			<section>
				<h3 id="things-to-try">Things to try</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Try doing the same thing with more clay or a shorter throwing time.</li>
					<li>Try to throw thinner walls, even though you may not like that aesthetic</li>
					<li>Try throwing a cylinder so tall and narrow you can't get your hand in to pull up, then use a throwing stick for pulling up on the inside.</li>
					<li>Try throwing a bowl so wide flat it could be a plate.</li>
					<li>Try throwing a smaller amount of clay to the same size.</li>
				</ul>
